    As a member of the public,
    So that I can get across town,
    I'd like a docking station to release a bike that is not broken.

    As a maintainer of the system,
    So that members of the public can get usable bikes,
    I'd like docking stations to only release working bikes.

    As a maintainer of the system,
    So that members of the public can get usable bikes,

    So that members of the public can get usable bikes,

    As a maintainer of the system,
    So that members of the public can get usable bikes,
    I'd like vans to come to take broken bikes from docking stations, take them to be fixed and then bring them back to the docking stations.

    As a maintainer of the system,
    So that members of the public can get usable bikes,
    I'd like garages to receive broken bikes from vans, fix them, and then pass them back to vans for distribution.

    So that a station can serve many members of the public,
    I want a docking station to have a default capacity of 20 bikes.

    So that busy areas can be served more effectively,
